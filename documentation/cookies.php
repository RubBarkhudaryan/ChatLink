            <h3>Managing Your Cookie Preferences</h3>

            <p>You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, it may affect your overall user experience.</p>

            <h3>Browser Settings</h3>

            <p>You can usually modify your browser settings to accept or reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your particular browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>

            <h3>Opting Out of Cookies</h3>

            <p>You can opt-out of certain cookies through your browser settings. However, please note that if you choose to block all cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of our website.</p>

            <h3>Do Not Track</h3>

            <p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature, which sends a signal to websites indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. There is currently no industry standard for recognizing and responding to DNT signals. As a result, our website does not respond to DNT signals.</p>
