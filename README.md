This is my first full-stack project Chatlink. It's a social networking website where people can share their photos and videos and chat to each other. 
In Chatlink I have used basic web technologies such as HTML / CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP and MySQL.
The functionality of the platform has all basic functions that you need. 

1. Sign In / Sign Up also included the reset password part,
2. Chat,
3. Following to others,
4. Blocking annoying users,
5. Uploading images and videos, redacting the uploaded images,
6. Downloading others posts
7. Settings such as edit profile, change theme (dark / light mode), managing blocked users and permanently deleting account

There are two users for test 
1. Login: frank_ , password: password
2. Login michelle_ , password: password
